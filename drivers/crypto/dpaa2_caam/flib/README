Runtime Assembler provides an easy and flexible runtime method for writing
SEC descriptors.

1. What's supported
===================
1.1 Initialization/verification code for descriptor buffer.
1.2 Configuration/verification code for SEC commands:
       FIFOLOAD and SEQFIFOLOAD;
       FIFOSTORE and SEQFIFOSTORE;
       SHARED HEADER and JOB HEADER;
       JUMP;
       KEY;
       LOAD and SEQLOAD;
       MATH;
       MOVE and MOVELEN;
       NFIFO - pseudo command (shortcut for writing FIFO entries using LOAD command);
       PKA OPERATION and ALGORITHM OPERATION;
       PROTOCOL;
       SEQ IN PTR and SEQ OUT PTR;
       SIGNATURE;
       STORE and SEQSTORE.
1.3 Support for referential code:
	patching routines for LOAD, MOVE, JUMP and HEADER commands.
	raw patching (i.e. patch any 4-byte word from descriptor)
1.4 Support for extended (32/36/40-bit) pointer size.
1.5 SEC Eras 1-6
	Below is a non-exhaustive list of platforms:
	Era 1 - P4080R1
	Era 2 - P4080R2
	Era 3 - P1010, P1023, P3041, P5020
	Era 4 - BSC9131, BSC9132, P4080R3
	Era 5 - P5040, B4860, T4240R1
	Era 6 - C290, T4240R2, T1040, T2080

2. What's not supported
=======================
2.1 SEC Eras 7 and 8.

3. Integration
==============
To integrate this tool into your project, rta.h file must be included.

4. Run
======
The examples are located in 'tests' directory:
   tests/
        kasumi_dcrc_decap_opt.c
        test_nfifo.c
        test_operation_alg.c
        make_rsa_keys_1.c
        ...

The provided Makefile contains the necessary include paths and compiler flags
to build all examples.

$ cd tests
$ make all
 or
$ make <test_name>

In order to run all examples, use
$ make check

This will automatically build the tests and run all of them sequentially,
saving the output in corresponding *.desc files.
