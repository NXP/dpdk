/* Linux has a good RB-tree implementation, that we can't use (GPL). It also has
 * a flat/hooked-in interface that virtually requires license-contamination in
 * order to write a caller-compatible implementation. Instead, I've created an
 * RB-tree encapsulation on top of linux's primitives (it does some of the work
 * the client logic would normally do), and this gives us something we can
 * reimplement on LWE. Unfortunately there's no good+free RB-tree
 * implementations out there that are license-compatible and "flat" (ie. no
 * dynamic allocation). I did find a malloc-based one that I could convert, but
 * that will be a task for later on. For now, LWE's RB-tree is implemented using
 * an ordered linked-list.
 *
 * Note, the only linux-esque type is "struct rb_node", because it's used
 * statically in the exported header, so it can't be opaque. Our version doesn't
 * include a "rb_parent_color" field because we're doing linked-list instead of
 * a true rb-tree.
