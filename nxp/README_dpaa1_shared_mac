DPDK with Shared MAC and Virtual Storage profile
================================================

The purpose of this write-up is to show the steps for running the DPDK applications with shared mac on DPAA1 platform.

For Building the applications and basic steps please refer to nxp/README file.

==========================
Changes in the  Kernel dts
==========================

The changes consist in adding shared mac port in the main dts, and vsp configuration as shown below. Sample DTS is at <dpdk>/nxp/dpaa/fsl-ls1046a-rdb-sdk-shared-usdpaa.dts
This README showcases fm-mac10 of LS1046 as an example.

+			fsl,qman-frame-queues-tx = <0x7e 1 0x7f 1 0x85 1>;
+		};
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Here 0x5f is the default Rx queue (see fsl,qman-frame-queues-rx property) which is requried to be configured in the fmc policy file as the default rule.

Once the board is up with the Linux DTB having shared MAC, user should be able to see 'fm1-mac10' as an interface in ifconfig.

Sample policy files have been added to support UDP and ESP traffic classified to user-space and rest all traffic to kernel.
See: usdpaa_policy_classif_udp_ipsec_1queue.xml and usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_10g.xml

NOTE: Also, the queue ID's used for classification (for DPDK flows) should match with the ones which are used in the DPDK default use-cases. i.e. 0x500 for mac1, 0x600 for mac2 ... 0xe00 for mac10.

================================
Running l2fwd in shared MAC mode
================================

Below are the steps to run fm-mac10 in shared mode with l2fwd receiving UDP and ESP traffic and rest going to kernel:

1. fmc -x
2. ifconfig fm1-mac10 <valid IP address>
   # At this point all the traffic which is sent on the interface (via spirent/network) will be received by the kernel.
3. mount -t hugetlbfs none /mnt/hugepages
4. echo 512 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
5. fmc -c usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_10g.xml -p usdpaa_policy_classif_udp_ipsec_1queue.xml -a
   # Once FMC is run kernel will not receive UDP or ESP traffic.
6. l2fwd -c 1 -n 1 -- -p 0x20
   # Now DPDK will handle UDP or ESP traffic, and kernel will handle rest of the traffic

If required after exitting the DPDK application run 'fmc -x' to remove the FMC configuration for DPDK, so that all traffic can again go to kernel.

NOTE: For DPDK to work, kernel shared interface must be up.
      Also, shared MAC is only supported in FMC mode.
