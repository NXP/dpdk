DPDK with Shared MAC and Virtual Storage profile
================================================

The purpose of this write-up is to show the steps for running the DPDK applications with shared mac on DPAA1 platform.

For Building the applications and basic steps please refer to nxp/README file.

1) Single Shared MAC port (fm1-mac10) Demo:

==========================
Changes in the  Kernel dts
==========================

The changes consist in adding shared mac port in the main dts, and vsp configuration as shown below. Sample DTS is at <dpdk>/nxp/dpaa/fsl-ls1046a-rdb-usdpaa-shared-mac10.dts
This README showcases fm1-mac10 of LS1046 as an example.

	chosen {
		name = "chosen";
		dpaa-extended-args {
			fman0-extd-args {

				cell-index = <0>;
				compatible = "fsl,fman-extended-args";
				dma-aid-mode = "port";

				fman0_rxt1-extd-args {
					cell-index = <1>;
					compatible = "fsl,fman-port-10g-rx-extended-args";
					/* Define Virtual storage profile */
					/* <number of profiles, default profile id> */
					vsp-window = <2 0>;
				};
			};
		};
	};


	fsl,dpaa {
		compatible = "fsl,ls1046a", "fsl,dpaa", "simple-bus";

		ethernet@9 {
			fsl,bman-buffer-pools = <&bp7 &bp8 &bp9>;
			fsl,qman-frame-queues-rx = <0x5e 1 0x5f 1 0x8b 1;
			fsl,qman-frame-queues-tx = <0x7e 1 0x7f 1 0x85 1>;
		};
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Here 0x5f is the default Rx queue (see fsl,qman-frame-queues-rx property) which is requried to be configured in the fmc policy file as the default rule.

Once the board is up with the Linux DTB having shared MAC, user should be able to see 'fm1-mac10' as an interface in ifconfig.
NOTE: Change to ethernet@8 for fm1-mac9 and also use the fman0_rxt0-extd-args with cell-index as 0.

NOTE: For fm1-mac9 - Change to ethernet@8 and also use the fman0_rxt0-extd-args with cell-index as 0.

Following dts examples are available as samples:
1. fsl-ls1046a-rdb-usdpaa-shared.dts - all ports are in shared mode with kernel.
2. fsl-ls1046a-rdb-usdpaa-shared-mac10.dts - only mac10  is in shared mode with kernel. Other ports are assigned to dpdk only. (i.e. userspace)
3. fsl-ls1046a-rdb-shared-mac9-only.dts - all ports are assigned to linux kernel. Only mac9 is shared with dpdk/userspace.


Sample policy files have been added to support UDP and ESP traffic classified to user-space and rest all traffic to kernel.
See: usdpaa_policy_vsp_24g_classif_udp_ipsec_1queue.xml and usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_mac10.xml

NOTE: Also, the queue ID's used for classification (for DPDK flows) should match with the ones which are used in the DPDK default use-cases. i.e. 0x500 for mac1, 0x600 for mac2 ... 0xe00 for mac10.

Other policy file examples to receive specific traffic to dpdk:
1. usdpaa_policy_vsp_classif_vlan_mac9_only.xml
	- splitting the packet on vlan id (example used is 0x100)
	 (config is: usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_mac9_only.xml)
2. usdpaa_policy_vsp_ecpri_1queue.xml
	- splitting packet on eth type as eCPRI with ecpri message type
	 (config is: usdpaa_config_ls1046_ecpri.xml)
3. usdpaa_policy_vsp_classif_udp_ipsec_mac10_1queue.xml
	- splitting traffic for ipsec esp and UDP for mac10, rest are normal hash
	(config is: usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_mac10.xml)
4. usdpaa_policy_vsp_24g_classif_udp_ipsec_1queue.xml
	- splitting traffic for ipsec esp and UDP on all ports
	(config is: usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_24g.xml)
5. usdpaa_policy_vsp_24g_classif_udp_gtp_1queue.xml
	- splitting traffic for udp destination port 2152 (GTP)
	(config is: usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_24g.xml)
6. usdpaa_policy_vsp_24g_classif_frag_gtp_1queue.xml
	- splitting traffic for UDP IPv4/v6 frags and dest Port 2152(GTP)
	(config is: usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_24g.xml)

Running l2fwd in shared MAC mode
================================

Below are the steps to run fm-mac10 in shared mode with l2fwd receiving UDP and ESP traffic and rest going to kernel:

1. fmc -x
2. ifconfig fm1-mac10 <valid IP address>
   # At this point all the traffic which is sent on the interface (via spirent/network) will be received by the kernel.
3. mount -t hugetlbfs hugetlbfs /dev/hugepages
4. echo 512 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
5. fmc -c usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_10g.xml -p usdpaa_policy_vsp_24g_classif_udp_ipsec_1queue.xml -a
   # Once FMC is run kernel will not receive UDP or ESP traffic.
6. l2fwd -c 1 -n 1 -- -p 0x20
   # Now DPDK will handle UDP or ESP traffic, and kernel will handle rest of the traffic

2) Multiple Shared MAC ports Demo:

==================================================
Running l3fwd in shared MAC mode on multiple ports
==================================================

Below are the steps to run fm1-mac3, fm1-mac4, fm1-mac5, fm1-mac6, fm1-mac9, fm1-mac10 in shared mode with l3fwd receiving UDP and ESP traffic and rest going to kernel:

1. fmc -x
2. ifconfig fm1-mac3 <valid IP address>
   ifconfig fm1-mac4 <valid IP address>
   ifconfig fm1-mac5 <valid IP address>
   ifconfig fm1-mac6 <valid IP address>
   ifconfig fm1-mac9 <valid IP address>
   ifconfig fm1-mac10 <valid IP address>
   # At this point all the traffic which is sent on the interfaces (via spirent/network) will be received by the kernel.
3. mount -t hugetlbfs none /mnt/hugepages
4. echo 512 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
5. fmc -c usdpaa_config_ls1046_shared_24g.xml -p usdpaa_policy_vsp_24g_classif_udp_ipsec_1queue.xml -a
   # Once FMC is run kernel will not receive UDP or ESP traffic.
6a. export P0_DIST='(0,0,0)'
   export P1_DIST='(1,0,0)'
   export P2_DIST='(2,0,0)'
   export P3_DIST='(3,0,0)'
   export P4_DIST='(4,0,0)'
   export P5_DIST='(5,0,0)'
   l3fwd -v -c 0x1 -n 1 --no-pci -- -p 0x3f -P --config="$P0_DIST,$P1_DIST,$P2_DIST,$P3_DIST,$P4_DIST,$P5_DIST"
    # Now DPDK will handle UDP or ESP traffic, and kernel will handle rest of the traffic

6b. Run testpmd:
    testpmd -c 0xF -n 1 -- -i --portmask=0x3 --nb-cores=2

NOTES:

1. If required after exiting the DPDK application run 'fmc -x' to remove the FMC configuration for DPDK, so that all traffic can again go to kernel.

2. For DPDK to work, kernel shared interface must be up. Also, shared MAC is only supported in FMC mode.
