NXP DPDK MULTIPROCESS SUPPORT : README
--------------------------------------
Supported Platforms (and their derivatives):
1. DPAA2 : LS108x, LS208x, LX2160

===============================================================================
NXP DPDK provides a set of data plane libraries and network interface
controller driver for Layerscape platforms
This is a supplementary document providing information about multiprocess
support in DPDK for NXP Platforms.

Terminology:
* Multiprocess: In DPDK context, this is a deployment model where multiple
independent processes are executed each of which can functional behave as
threads of a parent process.

* Parent/Primary Process: The first DPDK process which is run. In the DPDK
multiprocess model, this process is responsible for configuration of the
devices and any other common configuration to be used by the Secondary
Processes (look below). This process can also perform I/O on the devices.
While executing the process, if '--proc-type=primary' is used as an EAL
argument, the process is expected to be Primary. In case this is not the first
DPDK process, then this would result in error.

* Child/Secondary Process: Every next DPDK process which is started with
'--proc-type=secondary' EAL argument. Another way is to add '--proc-type=auto'
as EAL argument which automatically selects between Primary or Secondary.
NOTE: In case another instance of DPDK application is started but it is not
expected to be part of a Multiprocess model (separate DPDK instance), then
adequate configuration of Hugepages need to be done. By default, DPDK maps all
available hugepages which are only available for primary and secondary process.

===============================================================================

Various Multiprocess Models
---------------------------

Based on the functionality of the processes, the multiprocess model can be
categorized into two broad spectrum:

1) Symmetric
        A model where the Primary and Secondary process have similar
        functionality. For example, where Primary processes is performing
        I/O over one Eth device, while one or more secondary processes are
        also performing I/O on separate Eth devices.
        Or, if each device is equally shared across multiple processes for
        I/O.

        +----------+    +------------+   +------------+    +------------+
        | Primary  |    | Secondary1 |   | Secondary2 |... | SecondaryN |
        +-----XV---+    +------XV----+   +------XV----+    +-----XV-----+
              ||               ||               ||               ||
        +-----||---+    +------||----+   +------||----+    +-----||-----+
        | Device 1 |    | Device 2   |   | Device 3   |... | Device N   |
        +----------+    +------------+   +------------+    +------------+

Where, { X = Rx and V/> = Tx } signifying I/O (Rx/Tx, both). Another way to
visualize is where I/O (Rx/Tx) is performed by each process on same device,
maybe through separate queues:


        +----------+    +------------+   +------------+    +------------+
        | Primary  |    | Secondary1 |   | Secondary2 |... | SecondaryN |
        +-----XV---+    +------XV----+  +------XV----+    +------XV-----+
              ||               ||              ||                ||
              ||  .-------------`              ||                ||
              ||  ||   .------------------------`                ||
              ||  ||   ||    .-----------------------------------`
              ||  ||   ||    ||
        +-----||--||---||----||--+
        |         Device 1       |
        +------------------------+


2) Asymmetric
        A model where the Primary and Secondary process have dis-similar
        functionality in terms of I/O. For example, Primary process performing
        Rx on a device, transferring data to a Secondary process through some
        internal process mechanism (for example, Ring), which in turn does
        Tx on the same device.

        +----------+    +------------+
        | Primary  >----X Secondary1 |
        +-----X-V-V+    +------V-----+
              | | |            |         +------------+
              | |  `-----------)---------X Secondary2 |
              | |              |         +------V-----+
              | |              |                |
              | |              |                |           +------------+
              |  `-------------)----------------)-------...-X SecondaryN |
              |                |                |           +-----V------+
              |                |                |                 |
              |.---------------'                |                 |
              ||.-------------------------------`                 |
              |||.------------------------------------------------`
              ||||
        +-----||||-+
        | Device 1 |
        +----------+

Current implementation of NXP DPDK supports both mode on the Supported
platforms (listed above). The design of the application drives the model
being used.

Isolating the Resources
-----------------------

DPRC or DPAA2 Resource Container contains a number of resources which need to
be segregated between the Primary and Secondary Process. Initializing all the
I/O devices (dpni, dpseci, dpdmai, etc) is done by Primary - Secondary process
is not expected to initialize any I/O device. Only control devices like
fslmc:dpio, dpmcp need to be initialized by Secondary for its own work.

While executing the primary or secondary processes, list of devices to blacklist
(those which are not to be configured) need to be passed. Alternatively, a list
of all devices which are to be configured can be passed. This is list is
important as overlap would result in incorrect configuration.

0. Disable ASLR - Address Space Layout Randomization [1]
   This is default setting on various Linux distribution for preventing
   stack and other malicious address manipulation attacks. This works by
   randomizing the address-space layout of the ELF.
   This impact secondary process because the second or further process would
   attempt to find the same address space as the primary process (hugepage).
   This should be disabled using:

   echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

   [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization

1. Create enough fslmc:dpmcp devices
 - While creating the DPRC (./dynamic_dpl.sh script), create as many
   fslmc:dpmcp as the number of process expected to use the DPRC.

   $ export fslmc:dpmcp_COUNT=3  # for 1 Primary, 2 Secondary
   $ ./dynamic_dpl.sh dpmac.1 dpmac.2

2. Create enough fslmc:dpio devices to suffice the total number of cores being
   used across Primary and Secondary, plus one addition for each process.
   For example, in case Primary is to be run with 2 cores, and Secondary with
   2 Cores, total fslmc:dpio required are

   (Total Process = 3) x (3 fslmc:dpio per process) = 9

   Note: By default a large number of fslmc:dpios are created

   $ export fslmc:dpio_COUNT=10  # A larger number to accommodate conf changes
   $ ./dynamic_dpl.sh dpmac.1 dpmac.2

Assuming that following DPRC is created:

	$ restool dprc show dprc.2
	dprc.2 contains 58 objects:
	object          label           plugged-state
	dpni.3                          plugged
	dpni.2                          plugged
	dpni.1                          plugged
	dpbp.16                         plugged

	dpbp.12                         plugged
	dpbp.11                         plugged
	dpbp.10                         plugged
	dpbp.9                          plugged
	dpbp.8                          plugged
	dpbp.7                          plugged
	dpbp.6                          plugged
	dpbp.5                          plugged
	dpbp.4                          plugged
	dpbp.3                          plugged
	dpbp.2                          plugged
	dpbp.1                          plugged
	dpci.1                          plugged
	dpci.0                          plugged
	dpseci.7                        plugged
	dpseci.6                        plugged
	dpseci.5                        plugged
	dpseci.4                        plugged
	dpseci.3                        plugged
	dpseci.2                        plugged
	dpseci.1                        plugged
	dpseci.0                        plugged
	dpdmai.1                        plugged
	dpdmai.2                        plugged
	dpmcp.23                        plugged
	dpmcp.22                        plugged
	dpmcp.21                        plugged
	dpio.17                         plugged
	dpio.16                         plugged
	dpio.15                         plugged
	dpio.14                         plugged
	dpio.13                         plugged
	dpio.12                         plugged
	dpio.11                         plugged
	dpio.10                         plugged
	dpio.9                          plugged
	dpio.8                          plugged
	dpcon.8                         plugged
	dpcon.7                         plugged
	dpcon.6                         plugged
	dpcon.5                         plugged
	dpcon.4                         plugged
	dpcon.3                         plugged
	dpcon.2                         plugged
	dpcon.1                         plugged

Ignore dpni, dpbp, dpci, dpseci, dpcon - as they are all configured by the
primary process only. Secondary process is designed to skip them. But,
fslmc:dpio and dpmcp are important considerations.

3. Start Primary application with EAL arguments for blacklisting:

# Only allowing fslmc:dpio.8, fslmc:dpio.9, fslmc:dpio.10, fslmc:dpmcp.21 in
  Primary; Blacklisting all others

$ ./primary_process -c 0x3 -b fslmc:dpio.11 -b fslmc:dpio.12 -b fslmc:dpio.13 \
      -b fslmc:dpio.14 -b fslmc:dpio.15 -b fslmc:dpio.16 -b fslmc:dpio.17 \
      -b fslmc:dpmcp.22 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 -- <application arguments>

# Only allowing fslmc:dpio.11, fslmc:dpio.12, fslmc:dpio.13, fslmc:dpmcp.22 in
  secondary process 1

$ ./secondary_process1 -c 0x3 -b fslmc:dpio.8 -b fslmc:dpio.9 -b fslmc:dpio.10 \
      -b fslmc:dpio.14 -b fslmc:dpio.15 -b fslmc:dpio.16 -b fslmc:dpio.17 \
      -b fslmc:dpmcp.21 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 -- <application arguments>

# Only allowing fslmc:dpio.14, fslmc:dpio.15, fslmc:dpio.16, fslmc:dpmcp.23 in
  secondary process 2; ignoring dpio.17

$ ./secondary_process1 -c 0x3 -b fslmc:dpio.8 -b fslmc:dpio.9 -b fslmc:dpio.10 \
      -b fslmc:dpio.11 -b fslmc:dpio.12 -b fslmc:dpio.13 -b fslmc:dpio.17 \
      -b fslmc:dpmcp.21 -b fslmc:dpmcp.22 -- <application arguments>

Note: In the above format <bus>:<device> is the way to provide the device id
      for blacklisting/whitelisting

Note: Another method would be to whitelist all devices - but, that would require
      listing even the dpni, dpci, dpseci, dpcon etc. That would increase the
      length of the argument to unmanageable lengths.

Executing DPDK Example Application
----------------------------------

DPDK provides 2 sample applications which can be used for I/O using multiprocess
model.

./examples/multi_process/symmetric_mp # symmetric model example
./examples/multi_process/client_server_mp # asymmetric model example

Some other examples are also provided from NXP which use the available hardware
support in DPAA2:

./examples/multi_process/symmetric_mp_qdma # symmetric model with QDMA example

Detailed explanation can be seen from DPDK documentation:
https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/sample_app_ug/multi_process.html

Using the same DPRC shown as sample above.

1) Executing symmetric_mp with 1 Primary, 1 Secondary:

# Running primary process with single Core, 2 ports; assigning 1 dpmcp and 5
  dpio to it.

./symmetric_mp -c 0x1 -n 1 -b fslmc:dpio.13 -b fslmc:dpio.14 -b fslmc:dpio.15 \
        -b fslmc:dpio.16 -b fslmc:dpio.17 -b fslmc:dpmcp.22 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 \
        -- -p 0x3 --num-procs=2 --proc-id=0

In the above, "--num-procs=2" signifies 2 processes in total. --proc-id=0 is the
identifier for the primary process.

# Running secondary process with single core (not overlappping with primary),
  2 ports (same as primary); Assigning 1 dpmcp and 5 dpio to it. (We can ignore
  the extra dpmcp preserved for 3 process, if any)

./symmetric_mp -c 0x2 -n 1 --proc-type=secondary -b fslmc:dpio.8 \
        -b fslmc:dpio.9 -b fslmc:dpio.10 -b fslmc:dpio.11 -b fslmc:dpio.12 \
        -b fslmc:dpmcp.21 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 -- -p 0x3 --num-procs=2 --proc-id=1

In case more than one instance of application is to be executed, similar
blacklisting has to be done to distribute resources. Further, '--num-procs' and
'--proc-id' too need to be changed.

Send I/O to the ports assigned to the processes and observe traffic being
reflected back.

2) Executing client_server_mp with 1 Primary, 1 Secondary:

This sample application has two different applications which are executed as
server and client. Server process is responsible for Rx from interfaces (all)
and distributing to Client for Tx (one queue per device)

# Running server (primary) process with 1 Core, 2 ports; assigning 1 dpmcp and
  5 dpio to it.

./mp_server -c 0x1 -n 1 -b fslmc:dpio.13 -b fslmc:dpio.14 -b fslmc:dpio.15 \
        -b fslmc:dpio.16 -b fslmc:dpio.17 -b fslmc:dpmcp.22 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 \
        -- -p 0x3 -n 1

 # Running client (secondary) process with 1 Core, 2 ports; assigning 1 dpmcp
   and 5 dpio to it.

./mp_client -c 0x2 -n 1 --proc-type=secondary -b fslmc:dpio.8 \
        -b fslmc:dpio.9 -b fslmc:dpio.10 -b fslmc:dpio.11 -b fslmc:dpio.12 \
        -b fslmc:dpmcp.21 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 -- -n 0

Send I/O to the ports assigned to the processes and observe traffic being
forwarded.

3) Executing QDMA example application

symmetric_mp_qdma application is similar to symmetric_mp except that the
mbuf (buffer) transfers between Rx and Tx are done using the NXP DPAA2 QDMA
(dpdmai) hardware block.

# Running primary process with single Core, 2 ports; assigning 1 dpmcp and 5
  dpio, 1 dpdmai to it:

Assuming that there are two DPDMAI objects in the DPRC: dpdmai.1 and dpdmai.2,
the command is very similar to the symmetric_mp example:

./symmetric_mp_qdma -c 0x1 -n 1 -b fslmc:dpio.13 -b fslmc:dpio.14 \
	-b fslmc:dpio.15 -b fslmc:dpio.16 -b fslmc:dpio.17 -b fslmc:dpmcp.22 \
	-b fslmc:dpmcp.23 -b fslmc:dpdmai.1 -- -p 0x3 --num-procs=2 --proc-id=0


Notice the extra parameter "-b fslmc:dpdmai.1" as compared the symmetric_mp
command. This extra parameter conveys this process to ignore the dpdmai.1
block and use dpdmai.2 in Primary.

# Running secondary process with single core (not overlappping with primary),
  2 ports (same as primary); Assigning 1 dpmcp and 5 dpio, 1 dpdmai to it.
  (We can ignore the extra dpmcp preserved for 3 process, if any)

./symmetric_mp_qdma -c 0x2 -n 1 --proc-type=secondary -b fslmc:dpio.8 \
        -b fslmc:dpio.9 -b fslmc:dpio.10 -b fslmc:dpio.11 -b fslmc:dpio.12 \
        -b fslmc:dpmcp.21 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 -b fslmc:dpdmai.2 \
        -- -p 0x3 --num-procs=2 --proc-id=1

4) Executing l2fwd-crypto example application

l2fwd-crypto is a standard DPDK cryto demonstration application, which also
supports multiprocess model.

Primary difference with usual execution of l2fwd-crypto are the 'mp-emask' and
'mp-cmask' arguments passed - signifying ethernet ports and crypto ports,
respectively, which would be used by l2fwd-crypto instance.

Following can be a possible primary application command, using the same DPRC
as used for examples described above:

./l2fwd-crypto -c 0x3 -n 1 -b fslmc:dpio.13 -b fslmc:dpio.14 -b fslmc:dpio.15 \
        -b fslmc:dpio.16 -b fslmc:dpio.17 -b fslmc:dpmcp.22 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 \
        -- -p 0x3 -q 1 --mp-emask 0x1 --mp-cmask 0x1 --chain CIPHER_ONLY \
	--cipher_algo aes-cbc --cipher_op ENCRYPT \
	--cipher_key 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f:10 \
	--cipher_iv 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f:10

Secondary application can be executed like:

./l2fwd-crypto -c 0xc -n 1 --proc-type=secondary -b fslmc:dpio.8 \
        -b fslmc:dpio.9 -b fslmc:dpio.10 -b fslmc:dpio.11 -b fslmc:dpio.12 \
        -b fslmc:dpmcp.21 -b fslmc:dpmcp.23 -b fslmc:dpdmai.2 \
        -- -p 0x3 -q 1 --mp-emask 0x2 --mp-cmask 0x2 --chain CIPHER_ONLY \
	--cipher_algo aes-cbc --cipher_op ENCRYPT \
	--cipher_key 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f:10 \
	--cipher_iv 01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f:10


Extra Notes:
------------

1. l2fwd/l3fwd in their current design are not suited for multiprocess execution
   and hence would not work with substantial modification of segregating the
   queues and Rx/Tx processing.
2. For exiting the application, it is advisable to send SIGKILL to all the
   application. Similar to "killall <application name>". If not, all secondary
   should be killed first (Ctrl+C or SIGKILL) before the primary process.
