This fmc policy file establishes separate policies for network interfaces.  It includes
entries for all 1 G and 10 G interfaces on two FMan instances.	A given policy file need
not used them all.  The entries names end with an integer, 0 - 15.  The intended usage is
to associate them with FMan MACs as follows.

  fm0 dtsec0  - 0
      dtsec1  - 1
      dtsec2  - 2
      dtsec3  - 3
      dtsec4  - 4
      dtsec5  - 5
       tgec0  - 6
       tgec1  - 7
       tgec2  - 16
       tgec3  - 17
  fm1 dtsec0  - 8
      dtsec1  - 9
      dtsec2  - 10
      dtsec3  - 11
      dtsec4  - 12
      dtsec5  - 13
       tgec0  - 14
       tgec1  - 15
       tgec2  - 18
       tgec3  - 19

Likely, no single config file will use all of the policies in this file.

The policies form a key using only the IPv4 source and destination IP address and SPI
field of ESP header. The key is then used to hash to "count" FQs.  The base (i.e. first)
FQID is different for each policy.

If frame is non-ESP, the policies form a key using only the IPv4 source and destination
IP address fields. The key is then used to hash to "count" FQs.  The base (i.e. first)
FQID is different for each policy.

Non-IPv4 packets are sent to the default FQ, the ID of which is distinct for each
policy.
