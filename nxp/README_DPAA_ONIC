Interprocess communication using DPAA1 Hardware
-----------------------------------------------
This section give overview of how to use DPAA Hardware assisted interface for
interprocess communication. It require both applications to create an FMAN based
offline/onic port instance and configure it to be use it as a ethernet
interface.

Supported Platforms (and their derivatives):
1. DPAA: LS1046, LS1043

================================================================================
OFFLINE PORT
------------

Offline(O/H) port is a type of hardware port which is able to dequeue and
enqueue from/to a QMan queue. The FMan applies a Parse Classify Distribute (PCD)
flow and (if configured to do so) enqueues the frame back in a QMan queue.
Its maximum speed is 3.75 Mpps(2.5 Gbps).

The FMan is able to copy the frame into new buffers and enqueue back to the
QMan. This means these ports can be used to send and receive packets between two
applications.

An O/H port Have two queues. One to receive and one to send the packets. It will
loopback all the packets on Tx queue which are received on Rx queue.


		--------      Tx Packets     ---------
		| App  |-------------------->| O/H   |
		|      |<--------------------| Port  |
		--------      Rx Packets     ---------


To use this port to communicate between two applications, we can assign Rx port
of an O/H port to Application 1 and Tx port to Application 2 so that
Application 1 can send packets to Application 2. Similarly, we can assign Tx
port of another O/H port to Application 1 and Rx port to Application 2 so that
Applicaiton 2 can send packets to Application 1.

================================================================================
ONIC PORT
---------

To simplify this for DPDK applications, we have introduced ONIC ports.
Internally it will use one Rx queue of an O/H port and one Tx queue of another
O/H port. For application, it will behave as single O/H port.


		--------	--------	--------
--------   Tx	|      |   Rx   | O/H  |   Tx   |      |   Rx   --------
|      |------->|      |------->| Port |------->|      |------->|      |
|      |	|      |	|  1   |	|      |	|      |
|      |	|      |	--------	|      |	|      |
| App  |	| ONIC |			| ONIC |	| App  |
|  1   |	| Port |			| Port |	|  2   |
|      |	|  1   |	--------	|  2   |	|      |
|      |   Rx   |      |   Tx   | O/H  |   Rx   |      |   Tx	|      |
|      |<-------|      |<-------| Port |<-------|      |<-------|      |
--------	|      |	|  2   |	|      |	--------
		--------	--------	--------

All the packets received by ONIC port 1 will be send to ONIC port 2 and vice
versa. These ports can be used by DPDK applications just like physical ports.


Steps to use ONIC ports on LS1046 with l2fwd applications
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Mount hugepages:
	$ mkdir -p /dev/hugetlbfs
	$ echo 448 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
	$ mount -t hugetlbfs hugetlbfs /dev/hugetlbfs/

2. Load fmc configuration:
	$ fmc -x
	$ fmc -c usdpaa_config_ls1046_oh.xml
	  -p usdpaa_policy_hash_ipv4_1queue.xml -a

3. Run first instance of l2fwd Application:
	$ l2fwd -c 0x3 -n 1 -b dpaa_bus:fm1-mac10 -b dpaa_bus:fm1-onic2 --
	  -p 0x21 -q 1
   In this instance, l2fwd will use fm1-onic1 port and fm1-mac9 port.

4. Run second instance of l2fwd Application:
	$ l2fwd -c 0xc -n 1 --file-prefix 1 -b dpaa_bus:fm1-mac9
	  -b dpaa_bus:fm1-onic1 -- -p 0x21 -q 1
   In this instance, l2fwd will use fm1-onic2 port and fm1-mac10 port.

5. Send packets to first instance of l2fwd application(fm1-mac9 port).
   Packets will be received back from second instance of l2fwd
   application(fm1-mac10 port).
