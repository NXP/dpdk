NXP DPDK PTP (IEEE1588) README
============================
Supported Platforms (and their derivatives):
1. DPAA2 : LS108x, LS208x, LX2160

The feature is based on the asusmption
that test application will be single-threaded.

PTP feature can be tested using DPDK ptpclient
applictaion present in example directory.

Build Procedure
============================
Build DPDK
---------------

Now, follow DPDK build procedure mentioned in nxp/README to build DPDK

Build ptpclient application
---------------------------
Remove any previously installed arm64-build directory and rebuild it with
IEEE1588 support enabled.

#meson arm64-build --cross-file config/arm/arm64_dpaa_linux_gcc -Dexamples=ptpclient -Dc_args="-DRTE_LIBRTE_IEEE1588=1"

dpdk-ptpclient executable gets generated in arm64-build/examples/ dir

Test Set-up and pre-requisite
=============================
Two machines are required to be connected back-to-back
	1)Tester Machine to run ptp4l test application
	2)DUT (Board NXP platform) to run ptp4client test application

ptp4l test application can be directly installed on tester machine
via apt-install type commands
or build by downloading linuxptp package

Test Procedure with ptpclient
============================
----------------------
<Tester Machine>
	Start ptp server on tester machine.
	This will act as PTP Master
	eth1 is port on tester machine which is connected to DUT
	#./ptp4l -i eth1  -m -2


<DUT Machine>
	This will act as PTP Slave
	Create DPRTC instance and attach DPAA2 port to DPDK
	#export DPRTC_COUNT=1
	#source ./dynamic_dpl.sh dpmac.1

	Start ptpclient test application

	To synchronize DUT PTP Hardware clock with Tester Machine
	PTP Hardware clock
	#./ptpclient -l 1 -n 1 -- -p 0x1 -T 0

	To synchronize DUT PTP Hardware clock with Tester Machine
	PTP Hardware clock and additionally update system kernel clock
	#./ptpclient -l 1 -n 1 -- -p 0x1 -T 1
	To verfiy if System kernel clock is updated, read time before and
	after execution of above ptpclient command using date command.
